The purpose of our web application is to demonstrate and create awareness about the potential of Piezoelectric Roads, an innovative technology that transforms the mechanical pressure of moving vehicles into clean, renewable electricity. With millions of vehicles traveling on roads every day, a massive amount of kinetic energy is wasted. By embedding piezoelectric materials under road surfaces, this unused energy can be captured and converted into power for streetlights, traffic systems, and even nearby communities. Our web application allows users to simulate energy generation based on real traffic conditions, understand the science behind the technology, and visualize its environmental benefits. Ultimately, it serves as an educational and interactive platform to inspire sustainable smart-road solutions for a greener future
